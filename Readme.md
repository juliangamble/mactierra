## About Tierra

Tierra is a foundational step in the exploration of Artificial Life and genetic algorithms. In 1992 it demonstrated self-modifying programs 'evolving' and improving.  


## About

This is a Macintosh implementation of Tom Ray's Tierra: <http://life.ou.edu/tierra/>

It's an independent implementation by Simon Fraser <smfr at smfr dot org>, who write a Mac OS Classic version many moons ago: <http://www.smfr.org/work/sfi/mactierra/>

This is a Mac OS X rewrite, with a platform-neutral engine, and a Cocoa front-end. It requires Mac OS X 10.5.4 (Leopard) or later.

Please send bugs and feedback to Simon Fraser <smfr at smfr . org>


## How to build

Building requires Leopard (10.5.4) and Xcode 3.1 or later.

First, open Source/userinterface/cocoa/3rd party/GraphX/Source/Graph Suite.xcodeproj. Get Info on the Graph Suite item at the top of the Files hierarchy, and change the Build Products location to MacTierra/build (same directory as used by MacTierra.xcodeproj). Build Release and Debug (either target).

Now open MacTierra.xcodeproj, choose the MacTierra target, and build (Release or Debug, as you wish; Release will run much faster).


## Tips & Tricks

Use Command-Option-N to make a new, empty soup with mutation turned off.


## Genebank

MacTierra creates a "genebank" file at ~/Library/Application Support/MacTierra/Genebank.sql, in which it stores successful genotypes. You can view the genebank via the Window->Genebank menu item. Genotypes can be dragged into an empty soup to run them.


## Version History

0.8
    First release of Mac OS X version.
    
1.0
    Rebuilt on Mac OS X 10.6, with Boost 1.44.0
    Built 64-bit. Significantly faster than 0.8

    New soup format; soup files not compatible with 0.8.


## Known issues

Saving soups in XML format crashes sometimes (bug in boost serialization).
Soups may not be compatible between 32- and 64-bit binaries.
